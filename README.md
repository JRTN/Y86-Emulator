# Y86 Emulator

Created for my Fall 2016 CS 2011 Computer Architecture class. I know it's not the cleanest code, but there were 150 points of extra credit up for grabs (100 for the assembler; 50 for the disassembler) and I was pretty rushed at times.

It works, it's somewhat readable, and I got every piece of it done.
